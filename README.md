# Screen Timelapse
This is a work in progress utility to allow for easy screen capture of your screen on regular intervals. This will screen shot your computer on regular intervals and store the images in the images/ folder for access after the script is finished.

## Features
The script is designed to be fairly simple to use. When in the directory of the Repo, just run the following to get started.
```sh
./timelapse.sh
```
This will give the option to clear the current collection of images if desired, continue from a specified frame (stored in frameNumber.txt), or start fresh with no images present.

## Helper Script

```sh
./clearImages
```
